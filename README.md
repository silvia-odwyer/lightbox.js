### Demos
You can try out the demos [here](https://www.getlightboxjs.com/demo/).

## Getting Started
### Install

To get started, simply install the module via NPM:

```bash
npm install lightbox.js-react
```

### Usage
Once the library has been installed, import the CSS file for Lightbox.js within your React app's `index.js` file. You'll also need to import the function to initialize the lightbox with your license key. See the [details here](https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/lightbox.js#-getting-a-license-key) on how to get a license key.

```jsx
import {initLightboxJS} from 'lightbox.js-react'
import 'lightbox.js-react/dist/index.css'
```

Then, just initialize the license key within your React app's `index.js` file like so:

```js
  useEffect(() => {
    initLightboxJS("Insert your License Key here", "Insert plan type here");
  }, []);
```

The two plan types are `individual` and `team`.

Navigate to the React component where you wish to insert a lightbox, and import the component required:
```jsx
import {SlideshowLightbox} from 'lightbox.js-react'
```

Next, wrap the images in the `SlideshowLightbox` component:
```jsx
<SlideshowLightbox className="container grid grid-cols-3 gap-2 mx-auto">
    <img className="w-full rounded" src="https://source.unsplash.com/pAKCx4y2H6Q/1400x1200" />
    <img className="w-full rounded" src="https://source.unsplash.com/AYS2sSAMyhc/1400x1200" />  
    <img className="w-full rounded" src="https://source.unsplash.com/Kk8mEQAoIpI/1600x1200" />
    <img className="w-full rounded" src="https://source.unsplash.com/HF3X2TWv1-w/1600x1200" />
</SlideshowLightbox> 
```

### Next.js Guide
To get started with Next.js, be sure to take a look at [the Next.js tutorial here](https://www.getlightboxjs.com/docs/NextJsGuide/), which shows how to set-up Lightbox.js and create an image gallery that opens the lightbox when an image is clicked on.

### Full Example
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import {SlideshowLightbox} from 'lightbox.js-react'
import 'lightbox.js-react/dist/index.css'

class Demo extends Component {
  render() {
    return <SlideshowLightbox className="container grid grid-cols-3 gap-2 mx-auto">
    <img className="w-full rounded" src="https://source.unsplash.com/pAKCx4y2H6Q/1400x1200" />
    <img className="w-full rounded" src="https://source.unsplash.com/AYS2sSAMyhc/1400x1200" />  
    <img className="w-full rounded" src="https://source.unsplash.com/Kk8mEQAoIpI/1600x1200" />
    <img className="w-full rounded" src="https://source.unsplash.com/HF3X2TWv1-w/1600x1200" />
</SlideshowLightbox> 
  }
}
```

#### üîë Getting A License Key
Depending on the nature of your project, there are two ways to get a license key:
1. **Commercial product:** If you require Lightbox.js for a commercial product, then a license can be purchased from [our website](https://getlightboxjs.com/pricing). 
2. **Open-source:** If your project is open-source, then you can request a free license key from our [website's contact form](https://getlightboxjs.com/contact/).

## Development 
Contributions are always welcome! If you'd like to add new features or wish to work on the library, simply clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/lightbox.js
cd lightbox.js
```

Then, install the dependencies required:

```bash
npm install
```

To start the development server for the library, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

You can then make changes to the code and after any saved changes, the development server will provide live reloading and build the library. In order to view your changes, simply set-up and run the example demo as shown below. That way, when you make edits to the library, you'll see these changes reflected in the demo and can try out the lightbox upon making changes, and so forth.

### Running the example demo
An example demo has been set-up that integrates with the library. 

Navigate to `lightbox.js/example`:

```bash
cd example
```

Then, install the dependencies required:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, it's time to start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

And there you have it! You can now make changes to the library and the example demo will automatically update.
